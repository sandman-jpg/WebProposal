			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p>WIRES stands for the NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service. WIRES aims  to rehabilitate and conserve wildlife in Australia, as well as promote rescue and conservation efforts in the Australian community. Based in NSW, and serving as the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia, WIRES operates 7 days a week, every day of the year. WIRES provides the Australian community a 1300 hotline the public can call for assistance and advice on injured or sick native wildlife.</p>

      <p>WIRES currently has 28 branches in NSW dedicated to the rescue and care of native wildlife, with over 2, 500 volunteers. It has received over 150, 000 phone calls in the last financial year, and has helped over 90, 000 animals in that year. WIRES also partners with other oranisations for long-term wildlife conservation projects. WIRES has provided assistance for external wildlife conservation efforts, such as providing funding for wildlife carers, and vets. Additionally, WIRES plays a role in wildlife education, allowing the general public to visit their facilities. </p>

			<h4>Design Focus</h4>
      <p>According to the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, 73% of WIRES' income is from donations and bequests. This means donations are a crucial and extremely important source of revenue for WIRES to be able to operate. For this reason, I decided to focus on understanding how my design can encourage users to donate to this organisation.</p>

      <h4>Design Focus Research</h4>
      <p>There are many tips out there on how to encourage people to give to charities. There were a few that stood out to me.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A study (Lee & Feeley, 2016) found  that people were more likely to help  "specific, identifiable" individuals, rather than "anonymous, statistical victims" (Lee & Feeley, 2016). This is known as the "Identifiable Victim Effect". This effect can be seen in cases where there are many  public donations of money to people whose misfortunes have been well-publicised in the media. Additionally, as cited in Lee and Feely (2016), Kogut and Ritov (2005) found that participants, when asked to donate to children in need of life-saving treatment, were more likely to donate to children who had been indentified by name, age and  picture of them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reporting on the impact of the donations encourages people to donate. A Canadian charity organisation survey found that 73% of respondents indicated they were more likely to be a donor if the charity released donation impact results from the preceding year (Glogavic, n.d.). </li>
        </ul>
