			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p>WIRES stands for the NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service. WIRES aims  to rehabilitate and conserve wildlife in Australia, as well as promote rescue and conservation efforts in the Australian community. Based in NSW, and serving as the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia, WIRES operates 7 days a week, every day of the year. WIRES provides the Australian community a 1300 hotline the public can call for assistance and advice on injured or sick native wildlife (Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission).</p>

      <p>WIRES currently has 28 branches in NSW dedicated to the rescue and care of native wildlife, with over 2, 500 volunteers. It has received over 150, 000 phone calls in the last financial year, and has helped over 90, 000 animals in that year. WIRES also partners with other oranisations for long-term wildlife conservation projects. WIRES has provided assistance for external wildlife conservation efforts, such as providing funding for wildlife carers, and vets. Additionally, WIRES plays a role in wildlife education, allowing the general public to visit their facilities (Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission). </p>

			<h4>Design Focus</h4>
      <p>Donations are a crucial and extremely important source of revenue for WIRES to be able to operate. According to the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, 73% of WIRES' income is from donations and bequests. For this reason, I decided to focus on understanding how my design can encourage users to donate to this organisation.</p>

      <h4>Design Focus Research</h4>
      <p>There are many tips out there on how to encourage people to give to charities. There were a couple that stood out to me.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A study (Lee & Feeley, 2016) found  that people were more likely to help  "specific, identifiable" individuals, rather than "anonymous, statistical victims" (Lee & Feeley, 2016). This is known as the "Identifiable Victim Effect". This effect can be seen in cases where there are many  public donations of money to people whose misfortunes have been well-publicised in the media. Additionally, as cited in Lee and Feely (2016), Kogut and Ritov (2005) found that participants, when asked to donate to children in need of life-saving treatment, were more likely to donate to children who had been indentified by name, age and  picture of them.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reporting on the impact of the donations encourages people to donate. A Canadian charity organisation survey found that 73% of respondents indicated they were more likely to be a donor if the charity released donation impact results from the preceding year (Glogavic, n.d.). This is supported by a recent report (Charities Aid Foundation, 2019) which found that participants in the 18-24 year old age range were over twice as likely to contribute to a charity through a workplace giving initiative. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profile</h3>
			<p>The 2019 Charities Aid Foundation report, <em>Australia Giving</em>, found that 74% of 25-34 year olds had made a donation to a charity organisation in the preceding 12 months. The report also found that 18-24 year olds are more likely to volunteer for a charity than older members of society. While the broader target users would be people who take an interest in the welfare and wellbeing of wildlife in Australia, with younger people showing an active interest in charitable causes, I decided to focus my user profile on people in the age bracket of 18-34 years old.</p>

      <h4>The University Student</h4>
      <p>In interviews I conducted with adults in the target age range of 18-35 years old, I was able to construct a user profile. I conducted two interviews.</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>One interviewee was male, one interviewee was female.</li>
          <li>The male was aged 29, the female aged 25.</li>
          <li>Both are students undertaking university degrees.</li>
          <li>Both are currently not employed.</li>
          <li>It is worth noting both interviewees indicated they are likely to contribute to a cause or charity.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>

			<p>In my ideation stage, my main aims were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep a minimal design</li>
				<li>Represent the Australian landscape through design decisions such as colour</li>
				<li>Make the interface simple and easy to navigate</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Board</h3>
			<p>
        <ul>
          <li>I wanted to represent the Australian landscape and its native flora and fauna through the use of tertiary, earth-tone colours.</li>
          <li>I wanted the focal point to be on the featured animal.</li>
          <li>I added some simple drawings to add a sentimental, almost child-like quality.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>These are my sketches for the initial user interface planning stages. Here I explored both web and mobile layout options.</p>

		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The next stages in my design process were wireframes, and then mockups. I asked for user feedback on my wireframes as I created them, so I was able to refine them as I was making them. I received this user feedback through asking users to interact with my wireframes, and use the Think-Aloud method (Tomitsch, 2019).</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>I designed some rough wireframes for how the website would look on both mobile and desktop formats, with annotations describing the content.</p>
			<!-- Use the figure element for embedding images and iframes with annotations/captions -->

				<img src="/wireframe1.png" alt="placeholder image"/>

			<figure>
				<img src="/wireframe3.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>Wireframe 3: Mobile Donation Page</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>For Wireframe 3's form, I organised the input fields in the way Coyle (2020) recommended. I labelled the input fields, rather than using textbox placeholders, as placeholders rely on the user's short-term memory. I also kept the labels short, and organised related input fields inline with each other (as seen with first name and last name). I translated these design practices to the desktop version too.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="/wireframe4.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>Wireframe 4: Desktop Donation Page</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>For Wireframe 4, the added components would also be present in the mobile features. The main difference between the two layouts is that two different donation options would be visible on desktop at the same time, and to view any further options the user would scroll down;  whereas on mobile, to view any of the other options besides donation via credit/debit card, the user would need to scroll down.</p>
      <p>The added features are on account of comparing my wireframes to some existing website forms, as well as receiving verbal feedback from one of my interviewees when showing them the wireframes. For example, the user suggested there should be a custom option for donation amounts. I also added a Home Page icon so users could navigate back to the home page at any time.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="/wireframe5.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>Wireframe 5: Desktop "Current Projects" Page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>My idea behind Wireframe 5 is that each project is represented by an image. If the user hovers over one of the images, the icon would instead be a plain background, with text over it. The text would be a project title and brief synopsis of the project. This allows the user to scan the different projects quickly, and then click into one if they find the synopsis interesting.</p>
      <p>I also amended how the menu would present, so that it would always be visible in the header tab. One of the interviewees' feedback on the wireframes was that it would be annoying to have to go back to the home page to access the menu options. By implementing a permanent menu, users would always be able to view and click on one of the menu options regardless of where they are on the website.</p>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="/mockup1.png" alt="My desktop mockup I made in Illustrator"/>
        <figcaption>Mockup 1: Desktop Landing Page</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Mockup 1 represents a full screen rendition of the landing page on a desktop. The header would always be visible as the user scrolls down the page, so they always have the menu options, hotline and donation button available.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="/mockup2.png" alt="My mobile mockup I made in Illustrator"/>
        <figcaption>Mockup 2 & 3: Mobile Landing Page</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>For the mobile design layout, I chose to make it a more pragmatic design, as there is much less information you can put in mobile format without visual cramming.</p>

      <p>Mockup 2 and 3 represent the mobile landing page; Mockup 3 is after the user has tapped/opened the Menu. I added downward triangles on the bottom of the screen so users would know to keep scrolling if they wanted to read further. In Mockup 3, I flipped the triangle on the <em>Menu</em> button so that it would be inverse to when it was closed.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="/mockup3.png" alt="My web mockup I made in Illustrator"/>
        <figcaption>Mockup 4: Desktop Donation Page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mockup 4 is the Donation Page of the website. I changed the layout of the different donation options, so that they are vertically stacked. Based on user feedback, this would lessen any possible confusion on which form to fill out.</p>
      <p>Instead, I implemented options for them to choose from at the very start. The mockup depicts if the first option of <em>Credit/Debit Card</em> was chosen - if a button is chosen, the background colour and text of the button change to distinguish it from the others. This is to provide the user with interaction feedback. Additionally, if the user decided to choose any other option, the page would automatically scroll down past the Credit/Debit card form to the relevant form for the user to fill out.</p>
